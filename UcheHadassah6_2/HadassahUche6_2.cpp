/*Counting occurrences: Re-write the program given in slide 13 (Topic C-Strings) 
using a function: Write a function called Count which takes as parameters a string 
and one character and returns the number of times the character occurs in the string. 
Write a program to test your function with user-defined data.
For example: Assuming the string passed is “Hello” and the letter is “l”, your 
function should return 2.*/
